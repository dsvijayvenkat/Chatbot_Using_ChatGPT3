# Chatbot_Using_ChatGPT3

ChatGPT is an AI chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model and Gradio, a Python library for creating web interfaces for machine learning models. It is a powerful tool that can generate responses to user queries and messages based on a large corpus of text data.

OpenAI's GPT-3 is a state-of-the-art language model that has been trained on a massive corpus of text data, allowing it to understand and generate natural language responses. It is capable of generating human-like responses to a wide variety of topics and queries.

Gradio is a Python library that allows developers to quickly create user interfaces for machine learning models. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the model, making it ideal for creating AI chatbots.

Using OpenAI and Gradio, developers can create powerful and user-friendly chatbots that can generate responses to user queries in real-time. The chatbot can be customized to suit a wide variety of use cases, including customer support, product recommendations, and more.

Creating a chatbot using OpenAI and Gradio is relatively straightforward. Developers can start by setting up their OpenAI API key and importing the necessary libraries. They can then define the input and output interfaces of the chatbot using Gradio's input and output widgets. Finally, they can create the chatbot logic using the OpenAI Chat API and Gradio's interface functions.

Overall, ChatGPT is an excellent tool for creating powerful and user-friendly chatbots that can generate responses to a wide variety of queries and messages. By leveraging the power of OpenAI and Gradio, developers can create sophisticated chatbots that can help businesses and individuals alike automate their workflows and provide better customer support.

# Code Explination

This is a Python code that creates an AI chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model and Gradio, a Python library for creating web interfaces for machine learning models.

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries - OpenAI and Gradio. The OpenAI API key is also set in the code.

The messages list is initialized with a system message that will be displayed when the chatbot is launched.

The chatbot function takes an input message from the user and uses the OpenAI Chat API to generate a response using the GPT-3 language model. The response is then added to the messages list and returned to the user.

The inputs and outputs variables define the input and output interfaces of the chatbot. In this case, the input is a textbox where the user can enter their message, and the output is another textbox where the chatbot's response will be displayed.

Finally, the gr.Interface function is used to create the chatbot interface. It takes the chatbot function as an argument, along with the input and output interfaces, and additional parameters such as the title and description of the chatbot. The launch method is used to launch the chatbot interface on a web browser.

Overall, this code creates a simple yet effective AI chatbot that can generate responses to user queries and messages using the GPT-3 language model.

The code does not explicitly take a corpus as input. Instead, it uses the OpenAI Chat API to generate responses based on the messages exchanged between the user and the chatbot.

When the chatbot function is called, it takes the user's input message and appends it to the messages list. This list contains all the messages exchanged between the user and the chatbot so far. The chat object is then created using the openai.ChatCompletion.create() method, which takes the messages list and the GPT-3 language model as input.

The GPT-3 language model has been trained on a large corpus of text data and can generate responses based on the input message and the context provided by the previous messages in the messages list. Therefore, the corpus used by the chatbot is the corpus used to train the GPT-3 language model, which is provided by OpenAI.
